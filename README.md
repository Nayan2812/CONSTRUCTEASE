Virtual Reality (VR) is transforming the construction industry by improving communication and
teamwork, allowing teams to better visualize projects and solve problems together. It helps reduce
design mistakes and costly rework by providing a clear, 3D view of plans before construction begins.
VR also plays a key role in worker safety training, offering realistic simulations to prepare workers for
potential risks. However, adopting VR comes with challenges like high costs and the need for
technical skills, but it also opens doors for more efficient workflows. Beyond construction, VR is
widely used in tourism, education, and real estate, offering immersive experiences that enhance
learning, exploration, and property viewing.
